Hi! I am Marcel, a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich <strong>(TUM)</strong> under the supervision of <a href='https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/team/damlguennemann/'>Prof. Dr. Stephan GÃ¼nnemann</a>.

<strong> Research:</strong> My primary focus is on <strong>generative models</strong>, including variational autoencoders, diffusion, and score-based generative models. I also work on time series, graphs, and hierarchical structures. For a comprehensive overview of my background and research projects, please refer to my CV and publications.

<strong> Previously:</strong> I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from TUM. Following my graduation, I completed an internship as an applied scientist at <strong>AWS AI Labs</strong> in Berlin.

Feel free to write me an email if you are interested in discussing with me.
